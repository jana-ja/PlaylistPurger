# PlaylistPurger

A Compose Multiplatform App to sort out your collaborative Spotify playlist together with your friends.

Pick a Playlist and you have three possible options to vote for each track: keep it, toss it or don't care.
Use the list view to see all tracks and vote using the buttons.
Or use the swipe view to only see all your still un-voted tracks and vote via swiping or using the buttons.

When you and your friends are finished voting you can look at the group results to see which tracks are your favorites of the playlist and which should maybe be removed.
